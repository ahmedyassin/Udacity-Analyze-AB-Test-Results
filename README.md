Analyze AB Test Results

Scope

A company has developed a new e-commerce web page in order to try and increase the number of users who convert, meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product.

The main goal of this project was to understand the results of an AB test run by the website and provide statistical and practical interpretation on the test results.

Results

There was no clear evidence found to suggest that the new page converts better than the old one.

Looking for the Final results data we can find that: 1.Canada can be excluded in from our model (Baseline of the model). 2.US users numbers are around 1.04 times as likely to convert as Canadians users. Additionally, we can state that UK users are 1.05 times as likely to convert as Canadian users. 3.Looking at high p-values for all variables (all higher than 0.05) we can say that interactions between page and country have no significant effects on conversion.
